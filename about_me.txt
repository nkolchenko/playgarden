I'm an IT professional with ~10 years of experience with Linux, databases, web servers, monitoring tools, virtualization solutions, configuration management tools , container orchestration, etc. 

I used to work as a Team player as well as individually with minimal supervision in any kind of environment (startup or huge corporation) and always sticked to "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are" approach.

Keen on learning a new stuff and professional growth.

At the moment I'm actively looking forward to switch to SRE path. 

Some time ago I discovered an exiting world of K8s, GCP and automation and  I'd like continuing my growth in that direction.

At the moment I'm working on moving to Sydney, Australia. 
For that, I have already got an IELTS exam and reached a score of 7.0. I will be applying for  491 or similar visa after COVID-19  (and upon collection of all the needed documents).

Meanwhile, I'm looking for a trustworthy employer who can help me with sponsorship (so I can accomplish my goals much sooner) and let me grow professionally as well as personally.

Thank you :)
